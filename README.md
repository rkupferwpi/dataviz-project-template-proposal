# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is NICS background check data obtained from https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks.  The goal I'm working to primarily is a map of the US that shows the NICS background check data for that state as a pop up when the user hovers over a state.  Simultaneously, I'm working on a stacked bar chart to show the NICS background check data to present as my visualization if I'm not successful with my primary goal visualization.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
## Questions
 * What are the total number of background checks performed for the selected state?
 * How many background checks are performed for each category of background check for each state?
 * How do the background check totals vary over time?
## Tasks
 * How to convert the provided month-years to useable date formats
 * How to load in a map of the US that shows each state
 * How to associate the state names data with the map boarders
 * How to hover over or click on a state and obtain the data
 * How to make that data appear in a bubble over the state
 * How to make the data show the total for each year and by type of check (without having do modify the csv data to include totals)
 * How to make a legend with years that are selectable such that the data for each state appears for the selected year

 

## Sketches

![Sketch 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a18823-b548-4693-985d-c8444ea128ce)

![Sketch 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2deb32d-e055-4cba-9ea9-b99cb1e4b413)

Sketch 1 shows the data as I would like to present it, as a map of the US where the user can hover over a state (or click on a state) and have a bubble appear that shows the total background checks in the state and the total of each type of background check.  On the right hand side is a legend that allows the user to select from the available years the data is available for.

Sketch 2 shows the data in stacked bar chart form with each state on the x-axis and total on the y-axis.  The stacked bars form the total of each type of check with the total bar lenght the sum of the stacked bar.  On the right hand side is a legend that allows the user to select from the available years the data is available for.  As a bonus, if I went with this visualization, it would be interesting if it could play each year on it's own so one could see the changes in numbers of background checks over time.



## Prototypes

Currently I only have one year of data that I've loaded which was the exercise about how to load csv data.
import { csvParse, select } from 'd3';

export const viz = (container, { state, setState }) => {
  select(container)
    .selectAll('pre')
    .data([null])
    .join('pre')
    .text(JSON.stringify(state.data, null, 2));

  // state.data could be:
  // * undefined
  // * 'LOADING'
  // * An array of objects
  const { data } = state;

  if (data === undefined) {
    setState((state) => ({
      ...state,
      data: 'LOADING',
    }));
    fetch('data.csv')
      .then((response) => response.text())
      .then((csvString) => {
        const data = csvParse(csvString);

        for (const d of data) {
          d.month = d.month;
          d.state = d.state;
          d.handgun = +d.handgun;
          d.long_gun = +d.long_gun;
          d.other = +d.other;
          d.multiple = +d.multiple;
        }

        setState((state) => ({
          ...state,
          data,
        }));
      });
  }
};

The result was:
[
  {
    "month": "2023-09",
    "state": "Alabama",
    "handgun": 15421,
    "long_gun": 12848,
    "other": 1156,
    "multiple": 1052
  },
  {
    "month": "2023-09",
    "state": "Alaska",
    "handgun": 2429,
    "long_gun": 2543,
    "other": 262,
    "multiple": 197
  },
  .
  .

## Open Questions

Iâ€™m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data nor am I confident that I'll be able to associate the state name in the csv to the map data.  I'm also not confident about making the data selectable by year.

## Milestones

By the end of week six I would like to at least get the date in the csv into a working date in d3 and I would like to get the entire data set loaded and to figure out the coding to at least get the total number of checks by state.

## UPDATE 1

I loaded the map of the US showing just the state borders.  I was about to give up on the map idea and just do the bar chart but then I remembered to use the AI.  I would not have been able to do this without the use of AI.  I find this extremely discouraging.  Here is a picture of the map.

## Here is the index.js code

import { select } from 'd3';
import topojson from 'topojson-client';
import { map } from './map';

const worldAtlasURL =
  'https://unpkg.com/visionscarto-world-atlas@0.1.0/world/110m.json';

const usStatesURL =
  'https://unpkg.com/us-atlas@3.0.0/states-10m.json';

export const main = (container, { state, setState }) => {
  const width = window.innerWidth;
  const height = window.innerHeight;

  const svg = select(container)
    .selectAll('svg')
    .data([null])
    .join('svg')
    .attr('width', width)
    .attr('height', height);

  // state.data could be:
  // * undefined
  // * 'LOADING'
  // * An array of objects
  const { data } = state;

  if (data && data !== 'LOADING') {
    svg.call(map, {
      data,
    });
  }

  if (data === undefined) {
    setState((state) => ({
      ...state,
      data: 'LOADING',
    }));
    fetch(usStatesURL)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((topoJSONData) => {
        const data = topojson.feature(
          topoJSONData,
          topoJSONData.objects.states,
        );
        setState((state) => ({
          ...state,
          data,
        }));
      });
  }
};

## UPDATE 2 Week 7
I have updated my NICS stacked bar chart to include all the years in the dataset.  I've added a drop down to make the year shown selectable by the user.  I added an addtional drop down to allow the user to show the top 10 states, the top 25 states, or all states.  I've also added a pop up that appears when a user hovers over a bar to show the totals of each type of background check for that state.  Here are some pictures:

I've also updated my map viz to show a pop up with the name of the state the user is hovering over.  The goal is to get the background check types and totals to show up in the pop up.  Additionally, I updated the viz such that the state that the user hover over fills in with red color.  This is the viz that I would prefer to use for my project.  However, I feel like the most challenging step will be getting the NICS background data to associate with each state.  Here is a picture of what I did:

## UPDATE Week 9

I've added interactivity with the legend on my bar chart such that when the user hovers over the specific type of NICS check the opacity of the other types changes.  When the user moves away from the legend the opacity returns to 1 for all types.  Additionally, I've repositioned the legend, the year selector, and the top counts.
