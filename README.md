# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is NICS background check data obtained from https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
## Questions
 * What are the total number of background checks performed for the selected state?
 * How many background checks are performed for each category of background check for each state?
 * How do the background check totals vary over time?
## Tasks
 * How to convert the provided month-years to useable date formats
 * How to load in a map of the US that shows each state
 * How to associate the state names data with the map boarders
 * How to hover over or click on a state and obtain the data
 * How to make that data appear in a bubble over the state
 * How to make the data show the total for each year and by type of check (without having do modify the csv data to include totals)
 * How to make a legend with years that are selectable such that the data for each state appears for the selected year

 

## Sketches

![Sketch 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a18823-b548-4693-985d-c8444ea128ce)

![Sketch 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2deb32d-e055-4cba-9ea9-b99cb1e4b413)

Sketch 1 shows the data as I would like to present it, as a map of the US where the user can hover over a state (or click on a state) and have a bubble appear that shows the total background checks in the state and the total of each type of background check.  On the right hand side is a legend that allows the user to select from the available years the data is available for.

Sketch 2 shows the data in stacked bar chart form with each state on the x-axis and total on the y-axis.  The stacked bars form the total of each type of check with the total bar lenght the sum of the stacked bar.  On the right hand side is a legend that allows the user to select from the available years the data is available for.  As a bonus, if I went with this visualization, it would be interesting if it could play each year on it's own so one could see the changes in numbers of background checks over time.



## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
